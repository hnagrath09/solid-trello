# solid-trello

A Trello clone built to learn new technologies. This repository contains both frontend and backend code. This application is being built using OpenAPIV3 to automatically generate boiler plate code on both FE and BE side. Refer Readme.md file of `client` and `server` to respectively learn usage of OpenAPIV3.

## Frontend

I am using SolidJS + Typescript for frontend development. FE code exists inside `client` directory. Check out Readme.md file of client to learn more about frontend stack and usage.

## Backend

Server application is being developed using golang. All the server related code is inside `server` directory. Refer Readme.md file of `server` to learn more about backend stack and usage.
